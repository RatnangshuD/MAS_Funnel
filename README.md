F. Chen and D. V. Dimarogonas, "Funnel-based Cooperative Control of Leader-follower Multi-agent Systems under Signal Temporal Logic Specifications," 2022 European Control Conference (ECC), London, United Kingdom, 2022, pp. 906-911, doi: [10.23919/ECC55457.2022.9838497](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9838497).

## Introduction
- Multi-agent systems have applications in applications such as multi-robot
coordination, manufacturing and transportation systems.
- Hence the control of such systems is widely studied.
- Recent trend is applying formal methods based approach to specify complex and
high level speciﬁcations.
- STL, based on continuous time signals, helps formulating both time and space
constraints.

## Reference Paper
The paper focuses on leader-follower multi-agent network.
- Agents with advanced capabilities are selected as leaders and drive the whole
agent team to complete the task speciﬁcations.
- Complex and high-level task speciﬁcations are represented by STL formulas in
order to tackle both time and space constraints.
- Recent research mainly focuses on selection and controllability of the leader for
optimal performance.
- This paper introduces funnel based control in a leader-follower framework such
that the closed-loop system also satisﬁes complex high-level tasks represented
by the STL speciﬁcations.
